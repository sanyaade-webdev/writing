# Ideas

## General

* Provide a server, with live compilation, for local development.

## Interface

* Add pagination to posts.
* Generate an archives page.
* Support excerpts for posts.
* Keyboard shortcuts for moving between pages.
* Allow custom static pages, such as an about page.
* Configurable layouts for home, post, and archive pages.

## Performance

* Look into using [jslim](https://github.com/zgrossbart/jslim).
* Support compiling an optimized version.
* Consider caching models in local storage.
